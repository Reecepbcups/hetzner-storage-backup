# Hetzner Storage Backup

This is a simple program to backup, zip, and upload files via sFTP to a Hetzner Storage Box ($4/Mo for 1 TB of space).
It requires just some configuration, the storage box account information, and a Linux machine (bare metal or VPS from any provider).

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Reecepbcups/hetzner-storage-backup.git
# git clone git@github.com:Reecepbcups/hetzner-storage-backup.git
cd hetzner-storage-backup

# install required dependencies
# apt install python-pip3
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# copy the default file to the new config file you edit
cp secret.json.example secret.json

# Edit this file with the proper regex files you want to ignore, and folders you want to include.
# NOTE: if you want to match all, ensure you do '.*' as '*' does not work for standard python regex.
# Ex: '.*test/' will ignore 'hello_test/', even though there is no actual period (.) in it.


# BE SURE TO RUN THIS FROM THE ROOT OF WHAT YOU SET 'save-location' IN THE CONFIG
